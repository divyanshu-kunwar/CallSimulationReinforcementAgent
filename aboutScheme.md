## PM-KUSUM
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) Scheme for de-dieselisation of farm sector and enhancing the income of farmers.
Under the Scheme, central government subsidy upto 30% or 50% of the total cost is given for the installation of standalone solar pumps and also for the solarization of existing grid-connected agricultural pumps. 
Further, farmers can also install grid-connected solar power plants up to 2MW under the Scheme on their barren/fallow land and sell electricity to local DISCOM at a tariff determined by state regulator. This scheme is being implemented by the designated departments of the State Government.

The PM-KUSUM Scheme allows inter-se transfer of quantities between Component-B and Component-C. All three components of the scheme aim to add Solar capacity of about 34,800 MW by March 2026 with the total Central Financial support of ₹ 34,422 crore.

The PM KUSUM Scheme has the following components:
+ Component A: Setting up of 10,000 MW of Decentralized Ground/ Stilt Mounted Grid Connected Solar or other Renewable Energy based Power Plants by the farmers on their land.
+ Component B: Installation of 14 Lakh Stand-alone Solar Agriculture Pumps.
+ Component C: Solarisation of 35 Lakh Grid Connected Agriculture Pumps including Feeder Level Solarization.

## Salient Features

+ Component A:
    - Renewable Energy Power Plant (REPP) of capacity 500 kW to 2 MW will be setup by individual farmers/ group of farmers/ cooperatives/ panchayats/ Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO)/Water User associations (WUA) hereinafter called Solar Power Generator (SPG). In the above specified entities are not able to arrange equity required for setting up the REPP, they can opt for developing the REPP through developer(s) or even through local DISCOM, which will be considered as SPG in this case.
    - DISCOMs will notify sub-station wise surplus capacity which can be fed from such REPP to the Grid and shall invite applications from interested beneficiaries for setting up the solar energy plants.
    - The solar power generated will be purchased by DISCOMs at a feed-in-tariff (FiT) determined by respective State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC).
    - DISCOM would be eligible to get PBI @ Rs. 0.40 per unit purchased or Rs. 6.6 lakh per MW of capacity installed, whichever is less, for a period of five years from the Commercial Operation Date (COD).

+ Component B:
    - Individual farmers will be supported to install standalone solar Agriculture pumps in off-grid areas, where grid supply is not available.
    - CFA of 30% of the benchmark cost or the tender cost, whichever is lower, of the stand-alone solar Agriculture pump will be provided. The State Government will give at-least a subsidy of 30%; and the remaining at-most 40% will be provided by the farmer. Bank finance can be availed by farmer, so that farmer has to initially pay only 10% of the cost and remaining up to 30% of the cost as loan.
    - In North Eastern States, Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Lakshadweep and Andaman And Nicobar Islands, CFA of 50% of the benchmark cost or the tender cost, whichever is lower, of the stand-alone solar pump will be provided. The State Government will give at-least subsidy of 30%; and the remaining at-most 20% will be provided by the farmer.

+ Component C: Individual Pump Solarisation (IPS)
    - Individual farmers having grid connected agriculture pump will be supported to solarise pumps. Solar PV capacity up to two times of pump capacity in kW is allowed under the scheme.
    - The farmer will be able to use the generated solar power to meet the irrigation needs and the excess solar power will be sold to DISCOMs.
    - CFA of 30% of the benchmark cost or the tender cost, whichever is lower, of the solar PV component will be provided. The State Government will give at-least subsidy of 30%; and the remaining at-most 40% will be provided by the farmer. Bank finance can be availed by farmer, so that farmer has to initially pay only 10% of the cost and remaining up to 30% of the cost as loan.

The State Government will give a subsidy of at-least 30%; and the remaining at-most 20% will be provided by the farmer.

+ Component C: Feeder Level Solarisation (FLS)
    - Instead of the individual solar pumps the states can solarize the agriculture feeders. 
    - Where agriculture feeders are not separated, loan for feeder separation may be taken from NABARD or PFC/REC. Further, assistance for feeder separation may be availed from the Revamped  Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) of the Ministry of Power. However, mixed can also be solarised.
    - Solar plants of capacity that can cater to the requirement of the agriculture load of the selected feeder can be installed through CAPEX/RESCO mode for a project period of 25 years.
    - CFA of 30% on the cost of installation of solar power plant (up to Rs. 1.05 Cr/MW) will be provided. However, in the North Eastern States, Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Lakshadweep, and Andaman And Nicobar Islands 50% (up to Rs. 1.75 Cr/MW) subsidy is available.
    - The farmers will get day-time reliable power for irrigation free of cost or at tariff fixed by their respective state.

## How to avail the financial assistance ?

+ Component A:

In such a case, the land owner will get the lease rent as mutually agreed between the parties.
    - To avail of the PBI, the Implementing Agencies are requested to submit their claims for the projects which have been completed one year post their commissioning date, till 5 years from COD, along with the Signed Copy of the Joint Metering Report and Receipt of lease rent paid to the beneficiary/land-owner, wherever applicable.

+ Component B & Component-C (IPS):
    - State-wise allocation for solar pumps and solarisation of existing grid-connected pumps will be issued by MNRE, after approval by a Screening Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary, MNRE.
    - On acceptance of the allocated quantity by the implementation agencies and submission of the detailed proposal as per MNRE format, within a given time, the final sanction will be issued by MNRE.
    - Projects for solarisation or installation of pumping systems shall be completed within 24 months from the date of sanction by MNRE. Extension in project completion timelines, up to a maximum period of three months, will be considered at the level of Group Head in MNRE and up to 6 months at the level of Secretary in MNRE on submission of valid reasons by the implementing agency.
    - Funds up to 30% of the applicable CFA for the sanctioned quantity would be released as advance to the implementing agency only after placement of letter of award(s) to the selected vendors.
    - The balance eligible CFA along with applicable service charges would be released on acceptance of the Project Completion Report in the prescribed format, Utilization Certificates as per GFR, and other related documents by the Ministry.
    - MNRE CFA and State Government’s subsidy will be adjusted in the system cost and the beneficiary will have to pay only the remaining balance.

    - CFA applicable under the FLS can be released in the following manner wrt CAPEX/ RESCO mode of implementation of the FLS.
    - CAPEX:- Advance CFA up to 40% of the total eligible CFA will be released to DISCOMs on completion of tendering process and signing of work agreement with EPC contractor selected for installation of solar power plant. Balance CFA will be released on successful commissioning of solar power plant and plant starts supplying power to agriculture feeder(s).
    - RESCO:- No advance CFA. Further, the CFA up to 100% of the total eligible CFA will be released to the RESCO developer through DISCOM on successful commissioning and declaration of the Commercial Operation Date (COD) of the solar power plant.

## Component C (FLS)

+ The requirement of total annual power for an agriculture feeder will be assessed and a solar power plant of capacity that can cater to the requirement of annual power for that agriculture feeder can be installed either through CAPEX mode or RESCO mode, which will supply solar power to that feeder.
+ Feeder level solar power plant may be installed to cater to the requirement of power for a single feeder or for multiple agriculture feeders emanating from a distribution sub-station (DSS) to feed power at 11 kV or at the higher voltage level side of the DSS depending upon on factors like availability of land, technical feasibility, etc., and there is no cap of the capacity of solar power plant for feeder level solarisation.
